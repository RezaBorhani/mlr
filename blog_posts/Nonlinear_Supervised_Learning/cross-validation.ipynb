Cross-validation is necessary in order to prevent underfitting and overfitting - two undesired phenomena that we will see arise in solving any regression/classification problem. Our discussion will eventually culminate in the description of a specific procedure known as *k-fold cross-validation* which is commonly used in practice."

Since machine learning can be thought of as a set of tools for making sense of arbitrary kinds of data, i.e., not only data relating to a physical system or law, we want the relationship learned in solving a regression (or classification) problem to also satisfy this basic Occam's Razor principle. In the context of machine learning, Occam's Razor manifests itself geometrically, i.e., we expect the model (or function) underlying our data to be simple yet flexible enough to explain the data we have. The linear model in Figure 3, being too rigid and inflexible to establish the relationship between time and the distance an object falls due to gravity, fits very poorly. As previously mentioned, in machine learning such a model is said to underfit the data we have. On the other hand, the degree $12$ polynomial model is needlessly complicated, resulting in a very close fit to the data we have, but is far too oscillatory to be representative of the underlying phenomenon and is said to overfit the data."

This data-centric perspective provokes a practical criterion for determining an ideal choice of $M$ for a given dataset: the number $M$ of basis functions used should be such that the corresponding model fits well to both the current dataset as well as to new data we will receive in the future."
